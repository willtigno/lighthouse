            <h2>LIGHTHOUSE</h2>
            <p>Every month we ask our children what they would like in the facility as well as we look at what we might be lacking to help these children. Once we have determined the goal of the month's donation we begin to focus all the donations acquired this month towards the one thing these kids want whether it be more books in the library or a new playground.</p>

                <p class="left">The lighthouse offers children a safe haven from the depression of losing a loved one. For children losing a loved one could mean the end of their childhood and the beginning of an unending source of pain. We offer many different types of support. We can help children recover from the stage of grief through one on one consultations or even one of our many group support programs. Children can become more affected by the death of a loved one if the pain is not shared.<br/><br/>Our programs can be very diverse ranging from group events to one on one consultations. With a band of volunteers who are  only dedicated to helping  these children overcome the hardships of losing a loved one. With volunteers who are qualified to lead certain groups you can rest assured knowing you are being taken care in an environment of constant support.</p>

            <p class="left">The lighthouse was founded in 1999 by Jo Fallon who has experienced the death of her mother at a very young age.  Jo believes that the only way to get over grief is to talk to someone about the lost loved one. The lighthouse was founded on the principle of healing wounds created by the loss of a loved one and this is achieved by talking to people. Since today's society is  very fast paced the lighthouse is a house ready to accept any child who is grieving.</p>

            <p class="left">The lighthouse works in diverses ways to appeal to many different children in hopes of achieving only one ultimate goal and that is to help them recover from the grief caused by a loved one.   By introducing children to other children who are experiencing the same thing they are going through it can liberate them from the feeling of guilt and depression of grief as well as help them release their feelings in very healthy way.</p>
